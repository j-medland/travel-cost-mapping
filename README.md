# Travel Cost Mapping
Why not scrape travel prices from the web?

## Usage
* Install node 8.(something) and npm
* Install yarn (optional) with `npm install yarn -g`
* Install Chrome Browser with a version of or above 61 (use chrome://version to check)
* clone this repo and cd into the directory
* Run `npm install`
* Run `node index` to start the application

## Development
Consider removing the line 
```javascript
numberOfStations = 2
```
from index.js to allow all the prices for all stations to be scraped
